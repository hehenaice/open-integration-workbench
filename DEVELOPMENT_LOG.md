## Architectural Decisions

Format: `ADR-<seq>: <decision>` — decisions superseding spec defaults are marked with `DEVIATION`.

### ADR-001: Canonical IR rather than archive-as-source
- **Spec ref:** §4.1, §4.2, §7
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** Git-friendly text format decouples authoring from SAP proprietary artifact format. Enables semantic diff, deterministic builds, and LLM-friendly tooling.

### ADR-002: Original UI rather than SAP UI cloning
- **Spec ref:** §2.1, §2.2, §10.2
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** Legal safety. Familiar integration terminology permitted; pixel-identical copy of SAP UI forbidden.

### ADR-003: Modular monolith first
- **Spec ref:** §4.8, §5.1
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** Start as modular monolith with isolated workers; extract to microservices only when scale or security demands.

### ADR-004: JVM runtime worker for Groovy/XSLT
- **Spec ref:** §9, §16.1 threat 2
- **Status:** PLANNED (not yet implemented — runtime is currently Python prototype)
- **Rationale:** Process-isolated JVM with seccomp + network namespace for hostile Groovy scripts.

### ADR-005: Plugin SPI for steps and adapters
- **Spec ref:** §9.3
- **Status:** PARTIAL — Python plugin registry implemented (entry-point based); JVM SPI is future work.

### ADR-006: Git as source of truth
- **Spec ref:** §4.1, §11
- **Status:** ADOPTED — `.oiw/compiler.lock` records compiler version + digest per build; `dist/` is gitignored.

### ADR-007: Typed agent patches (never raw file edits)
- **Spec ref:** §12.1, §12.5
- **Status:** ADOPTED — `apps/cli/oiw/patch.py` implements 6 patch operations; used by both UI and MCP server.

### ADR-008: Approval-gated deployment
- **Spec ref:** §4.4, §15.2
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — implementation deferred to Phase 4.

### ADR-009: EMG with graph matching rather than unstructured pattern bank
- **Spec ref:** §13
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — implementation deferred to Phase 5.

### ADR-010: PostgreSQL/pgvector before dedicated graph DB
- **Spec ref:** §13.16
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — implementation deferred to Phase 5.

### ADR-011..020: per spec §25
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — individually addressed when their subsystems are implemented.

### ADR-PY-001: Phase 0/1 implementation language is Python (DEVIATION from spec §6.2)
- **Spec ref:** §6.2 (spec mandates Kotlin 2.1 + Spring Boot 3.4 + picocli CLI)
- **Status:** DEVIATION — TEMPORARY
- **Rationale:** Python for fast bootstrap; IR schemas, validation rules, test fixtures are language-agnostic and survive migration.
- **Migration plan:** OW-001.

### ADR-PY-002: Python FastAPI prototype for the REST API server (DEVIATION from spec §6.2)
- **Spec ref:** §6.2, §21.1
- **Status:** DEVIATION — TEMPORARY
- **Rationale:** Thin shim over `oiw` CLI; unblocks SPA development immediately. OpenAPI contract survives migration.
- **Migration plan:** OW-002.

### ADR-PY-003: Python MCP server prototype (DEVIATION from spec §5.1)
- **Spec ref:** §5.1, §12.4, §21.3
- **Status:** DEVIATION — TEMPORARY
- **Rationale:** Thin protocol adapter over `oiw` CLI; 11 MCP tools implemented and tested. JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.
- **Migration plan:** OW-002 (MCP server re-implemented in Kotlin alongside the server).

### ADR-PY-004: Python model gateway prototype (DEVIATION from spec §5.1)
- **Spec ref:** §5.1, §12.7
- **Status:** DEVIATION — TEMPORARY
- **Rationale:** FastAPI service with redaction, budget tracking, circuit breaker, prompt-injection defense. 5 LLM providers supported.
- **Migration plan:** OW-002 (model gateway re-implemented in Kotlin alongside the server).

### ADR-CI-001: GitHub Actions are the validation gate
- **Spec ref:** §14.4, §11.6
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** 10 required CI jobs (validate-pr aggregate as required status check). Branch protection on `main`.
