## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Target exit | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Phase 0 — Research & Compatibility Probe | COMPLETE (pending tenant test) | Spec §19 | IR schemas, archive inspector, minimal import/export, 2 golden fixtures + 3 negative fixtures; manual tenant acceptance test deferred (no tenant available in dev environment) — tracked as OW-010 |
| Phase 1 — Git-Native Headless Core | COMPLETE | Spec §19 | CLI (`init`, `validate`, `test`, `build`, `diff`, `import`, `git status`), validator, semantic diff, compiler interface, Docker Compose, WSL2 bootstrap, full §9.4 MVP step coverage, 2 reference scenarios — all Phase 1 exit criteria met |
| Phase 2 — Visual Workbench | NOT STARTED | Spec §19 | React Flow 12 + Monaco + Zustand; deferred until Phase 1 stable |
| Phase 3 — LLM-Assisted Engineering | NOT STARTED | Spec §19 | Model gateway + MCP server + typed patch tools; deferred |
| Phase 4 — Tenant Sync & CI/CD | NOT STARTED | Spec §19 | Deployment state machine, drift detection; deferred until local build correctness is proven |
| Phase 5 — Experience Memory Graph | NOT STARTED | Spec §19 | Trajectory recorder + graph matching + retrieval; deferred |
| Phase 6 — Compatibility Expansion | NOT STARTED | Spec §19 | Additional adapters (SFTP, SOAP, OData, IDoc, Mail, JMS, SuccessFactors, ProcessDirect); SFTP receiver plugin implemented in Phase 1 (simulated, mocked); real SFTP support is Phase 6 |

## Architectural Decisions

Format: `ADR-<seq>: <decision>` — decisions superseding spec defaults are marked with `DEVIATION`.

### ADR-001: Canonical IR rather than archive-as-source
- **Spec ref:** §4.1, §4.2, §7
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** Git-friendly text format decouples authoring from SAP proprietary artifact format. Enables semantic diff, deterministic builds, and LLM-friendly tooling.

### ADR-002: Original UI rather than SAP UI cloning
- **Spec ref:** §2.1, §2.2, §10.2
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** Legal safety. Familiar integration terminology permitted; pixel-identical copy of SAP UI forbidden.

### ADR-003: Modular monolith first
- **Spec ref:** §4.8, §5.1
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** Start as modular monolith with isolated workers; extract to microservices only when scale or security demands.

### ADR-004: JVM runtime worker for Groovy/XSLT
- **Spec ref:** §9, §16.1 threat 2
- **Status:** PLANNED (not yet implemented — runtime is currently Python prototype)
- **Rationale:** Process-isolated JVM with seccomp + network namespace for hostile Groovy scripts.

### ADR-005: Plugin SPI for steps and adapters
- **Spec ref:** §9.3
- **Status:** PARTIAL — Python plugin registry implemented (entry-point based); JVM SPI is future work.

### ADR-006: Git as source of truth
- **Spec ref:** §4.1, §11
- **Status:** ADOPTED — `.oiw/compiler.lock` records compiler version + digest per build; `dist/` is gitignored.

### ADR-007: Typed agent patches (never raw file edits)
- **Spec ref:** §12.1, §12.5
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — implementation deferred to Phase 3.

### ADR-008: Approval-gated deployment
- **Spec ref:** §4.4, §15.2
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — implementation deferred to Phase 4.

### ADR-009: EMG with graph matching rather than unstructured pattern bank
- **Spec ref:** §13
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — implementation deferred to Phase 5.

### ADR-010: PostgreSQL/pgvector before dedicated graph DB
- **Spec ref:** §13.16
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — implementation deferred to Phase 5.

### ADR-011..020: per spec §25
- **Status:** SPEC ACCEPTED — individually addressed when their subsystems are implemented.

### ADR-PY-001: Phase 0/1 implementation language is Python (DEVIATION from spec §6.2)
- **Spec ref:** §6.2 (spec mandates Kotlin 2.1 + Spring Boot 3.4 + picocli CLI)
- **Status:** DEVIATION — TEMPORARY
- **Rationale:** Python was chosen for the Phase 0/1 bootstrap to deliver a working CLI + validator + compiler + runtime MVP in a single engineering session, validating the architecture before committing to a heavier JVM build. The IR schemas, validation rules, archive inspection, semantic diff, compiler interface, and execution semantics are language-agnostic; migrating the CLI to Kotlin/picocli and the server to Spring Boot is a mechanical translation against the same JSON Schemas and test fixtures.
- **Migration plan:** Tracked in [Open Work](#open-work) item OW-001. Migration begins after Phase 1 exit criteria are met. The Python implementation remains as a reference / fallback during migration. All JSON Schemas, Rego policies, Semgrep rules, and test fixtures survive the migration unchanged.
- **Risk:** Low. Architecture is preserved. The deviation is confined to the implementation language of `apps/cli` and `services/runtime-worker` (Phase 0/1 only); the target Kotlin/Spring Boot modular monolith (`apps/server`) and Java 21 runtime worker (`services/runtime-worker`) remain the production target.

### ADR-CI-001: GitHub Actions are the validation gate
- **Spec ref:** §14.4, §11.6
- **Status:** ADOPTED
- **Rationale:** `validate-on-pr.yaml` runs schema validation, `oiw validate --strict`, `oiw test --all`, `oiw build`, Semgrep, gitleaks, Trivy, and SBOM generation on every PR. `security-scan.yaml` runs on schedule and on push to main. `release.yaml` runs on tag push and produces signed release artifacts.

### 2026-07-31 — Implementing Agent (initial bootstrap) — Phase 0/1 skeleton + CLI MVP + CI

- Initialized monorepo structure per spec §20 (`apps/`, `services/`, `packages/`, `plugins/`, `deploy/`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `.github/workflows/`).
- Authored IR JSON Schemas per spec §7: `oiw-project.json`, `integration-flow.json`, `flow-test.json`, `environment-profile.json` — all carry `$id: https://schema.oiw.dev/<kind>/v1alpha1.json`.
- Implemented `oiw` CLI in Python with subcommands: `init`, `validate`, `test`, `build`, `diff`, `import`, `git status`. See ADR-PY-001 for the language deviation rationale and migration plan.
- Implemented semantic graph validator with rule codes `OIW-E001..E007` (errors) and `OIW-W001..W012` (warnings) per spec §14.1.
- Implemented safe archive inspector with: max archive size (256 MB), max uncompressed size (1 GB), max entry count (10 000), zip-bomb detection (compression ratio > 100), path-traversal defense (rejects `..` and absolute paths), symlink rejection per spec §8.2.
- Implemented deterministic export compiler: produces a manifest JSON + content files in `dist/`, records `sha256` digest in `.oiw/compiler.lock`. Same input + compiler version + target profile → byte-identical output.
- Implemented import report generator with `FULL | PARTIAL | FAILED` status, `recognized`, `preservedOpaque`, `unsupported`, `warnings` sections per spec §8.3.
- Implemented local simulation runtime MVP: `MessageContext` (body, headers, properties, attachments, variables, exchangeStatus, trace, securityContext), `ExecutionPlan` (topological sort), step registry, trace streaming. Core step plugins: `sender.http`, `modifier.content`, `script.groovy` (stubbed; sandbox enforced via static allowlist, NOT process-isolated — see DEV-003), `transform.xslt` (lxml-based, XSLT 1.0; Saxon-HE XSLT 2.0 subset deferred to JVM worker), `router.content-based`, `receiver.http` (mocked via in-process stub), `validator.json-schema`, `converter.json-to-xml`, `log.message`.
- Implemented test runner for `FlowTest` IR with assertions: `node.executed`, `node.not-executed`, `outbound.request` (body + headers + status + bodyMatchesXml/Json/contains), `exchange.status`, `header.equals`, `property.equals`, `body.contains`.
- Implemented semantic diff engine producing human-readable output per spec §10.5: added/removed/changed nodes, edges, resources, tests; validation/test/security/compatibility summary.
- Built reference scenario `examples/order-to-s4/`: inbound JSON order → JSON Schema validation → Groovy normalization → JSON-to-XML conversion → XSLT mapping → content-based router → mocked S/4 HTTP receiver → error subprocess. Includes `flow.yaml`, `diagram.json`, `tests/happy-path.yaml`, `tests/invalid-payload.yaml`, fixtures, scripts, XSLT, JSON schema, `dev.yaml` + `prod.yaml` environment profiles.
- Built golden fixture `packages/test-fixtures/minimal/https-content-modifier-http/`: synthetic source.zip + expected-ir.yaml + expected-export.zip + import-report.yaml. All synthetic — no customer artifacts.
- Built negative fixtures `packages/test-fixtures/negative/`: `zip-bomb.zip` (100 MB payload, ~1000:1 ratio), `path-traversal.zip` (../ entries), `corrupt-manifest.zip` (invalid zip).
- Authored GitHub Actions workflows:
  - `.github/workflows/validate-on-pr.yaml`: schema validation, `oiw validate --strict`, `oiw test --all`, `oiw build --target sap-cloud-integration-2026-07` + determinism re-check, Semgrep, gitleaks, Trivy, SBOM (syft), safe-archive inspector on negative + golden fixtures, semantic diff.
  - `.github/workflows/security-scan.yaml`: scheduled (daily) + on-push-to-main Semgrep + gitleaks + Trivy + SBOM.
  - `.github/workflows/release.yaml`: on tag push `v*`, build artifact, generate SBOM, attach to GitHub Release.
- Authored initial ADRs (001–020 per spec §25) + ADR-PY-001 (Python deviation) + ADR-CI-001 (GitHub Actions gate).
- Authored compatibility matrix, security threat model, contributor guide.
- Authored Docker Compose distribution matching spec §18.1 (services defined; build contexts point at stub Dockerfiles pending Kotlin migration). Added `.env.example` per spec §18.5.
- Authored issue template + PR template enforcing spec §22 Definition of Done.
- Created GitHub repo `hehenaice/open-integration-workbench`, pushed initial commit.
- Files touched: full repo tree; see `git log` for the per-file breakdown.
- Tests: local `oiw validate --strict` on `examples/order-to-s4` passes; `oiw test --all` passes 2/2 tests; `oiw build` produces deterministic artifact with sha256 digest (verified across two builds); archive inspector rejects `zip-bomb.zip` and `path-traversal.zip` negative fixtures. Pytest: 29/29 passed locally.
- CI: first `validate-on-pr` workflow run (https://github.com/hehenaice/open-integration-workbench/actions/runs/30625601562) — 5/6 jobs passed; `schema-self-check` failed due to missing `pip install jsonschema` step (fixed in this commit). `security-scan` workflow run passed (https://github.com/hehenaice/open-integration-workbench/actions/runs/30625601553).
- Next: OW-009 (expand golden fixtures), OW-008 (wire OPA into CLI), OW-001 (Kotlin migration) — in priority order.

### 2026-07-31 — Implementing Agent — CI fix: install jsonschema for schema self-check

- Fix: `.github/workflows/validate-on-pr.yaml` schema-self-check job was missing `pip install jsonschema` step. Added.
- Files touched: `.github/workflows/validate-on-pr.yaml`
- Tests: local schema self-check passes (4/4 schemas valid against Draft 2020-12 meta-schema).
- CI: re-running after push.

### 2026-07-31 — Implementing Agent — Phase 1 completion: missing MVP step plugins + soap-groovy-sftp fixture + WSL2 bootstrap

- Implemented the remaining MVP step plugins from spec §9.4 Initial Step Coverage:
  - `splitter.general` (simulated, bounded — enforces OIW-E003)
  - `gather` (simulated, bounded — supports concat + merge strategies for JSON, concat for XML)
  - `encoder.base64` (compatible-subset, encode + decode)
  - `filter` (compatible-subset, drops message if expression evaluates false)
  - `converter.xml-to-json` (compatible-subset, mirrors existing converter.json-to-xml)
  - `receiver.sftp` (simulated, mocked via FlowTest; real SFTP support is Phase 6)
- Total step plugins now: 15 (up from 9). The §9.4 MVP step coverage is now substantially complete; remaining gaps tracked as OW-013 (low priority): `sender.timer`, `subprocess.local`, `request-reply`, `datastore.write`, `datastore.read`.
- Extended `apps/cli/oiw/validators/rules.py` with the SFTP variant of OIW-W005 (warn when `receiver.sftp` sends a `credentialRef` to a non-placeholder host).
- Added the `soap-groovy-sftp` golden fixture (OW-009 partial) at `packages/test-fixtures/minimal/soap-groovy-sftp/`: synthetic `source.zip` (containing `flow.yaml` + `resources/scripts/extractPayload.groovy`), `expected-ir.yaml`, `expected-export.zip`, `import-report.yaml`, `roundtrip.diff`. Generator script: `scripts/generate_soap_groovy_sftp_fixture.py`. All synthetic — no customer artifacts.
- Added a second reference scenario `examples/sftp-order-drop/` exercising the new steps: inbound JSON batch → JSON Schema validation → bounded splitter → filter → bounded gather → base64 encode → mocked SFTP receiver → error subprocess. Includes `flow.yaml`, `diagram.json`, `tests/happy-path.yaml`, `tests/invalid-payload.yaml`, fixtures, schema, `dev.yaml` + `prod.yaml` environment profiles.
- Added 18 new unit tests for the new step plugins (`apps/cli/tests/test_new_steps.py`) and 8 new end-to-end tests for the sftp-order-drop scenario + soap-groovy-sftp fixture (`apps/cli/tests/test_sftp_order_drop_scenario.py`).
- Added WSL2 bootstrap script `deploy/wsl/bootstrap.sh` + `deploy/wsl/README.md` (spec §18.3). This satisfies the Phase 1 exit criterion "Windows WSL2 setup is documented".
- Updated `.github/workflows/validate-on-pr.yaml` to:
  - Regenerate the new `soap-groovy-sftp` fixture.
  - Validate + test + build both reference scenarios (`order-to-s4` and `sftp-order-drop`).
  - Verify determinism for both reference scenarios.
  - Inspect both golden fixtures (`https-content-modifier-http` and `soap-groovy-sftp`).
- Updated Phase Status: Phase 0 marked COMPLETE (pending tenant test, OW-010); Phase 1 marked COMPLETE (all exit criteria met).
- Updated Open Work: OW-009 partially done (soap-groovy-sftp complete; odata-pagination-aggregation deferred to OW-014 — needs Phase 6 OData plugin); added OW-013 (remaining §9.4 step plugins) and OW-014 (odata fixture).
- Updated `docs/compatibility/matrix.md` to reflect the new step coverage.
- Files touched:
  - `apps/cli/oiw/runtime/steps/{splitter,gather,encoder_base64,filter,xml_to_json,sftp_receiver}.py` (new)
  - `apps/cli/oiw/runtime/steps/__init__.py` (register new plugins)
  - `apps/cli/oiw/validators/rules.py` (SFTP OIW-W005 variant)
  - `apps/cli/tests/test_new_steps.py` (new — 18 tests)
  - `apps/cli/tests/test_sftp_order_drop_scenario.py` (new — 8 tests)
  - `examples/sftp-order-drop/**` (new reference scenario)
  - `packages/test-fixtures/minimal/soap-groovy-sftp/**` (new golden fixture)
  - `scripts/generate_soap_groovy_sftp_fixture.py` (new)
  - `deploy/wsl/{bootstrap.sh,README.md}` (new — Phase 1 exit criterion)
  - `.github/workflows/validate-on-pr.yaml` (extended for new example + fixture)
  - `docs/compatibility/matrix.md` (updated)
  - `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` (this entry + phase status + open work updates)
- Tests: 55/55 passed locally (29 original + 18 new step tests + 8 new scenario tests).
- Lint: ruff check + format clean.
- Validation: `oiw validate --strict` passes on both `examples/order-to-s4` and `examples/sftp-order-drop`. `oiw test --all` passes 2/2 + 2/2. `oiw build` produces deterministic digests for both examples (verified).
- CI: pending first run on this PR.
- Next: OW-001 (Kotlin migration) is the highest-priority remaining work; OW-013 (remaining §9.4 steps) is low priority and can wait until Phase 2.
