"""Seed corpus promotion pipeline (WP-06 Task A-004).

Spec ref: §15.14 (Seed Corpus), §15.10 (Memory Promotion).

Auto-promotes synthesized seed trajectories through the full promotion
workflow: CAPTURED → REDACTED → OUTCOME_VERIFIED → MATCHED →
INSIGHT_GENERATED → REVIEWED → PROJECT_APPROVED.

The seed corpus bypasses human review because:
  - All artifacts are public and license-audited
  - All trajectories are synthesized from verified artifacts
  - The promotion is recorded with provenance.source = "seed-corpus"
  - Seed insights have confidence *= 0.8 (discount for synthetic origin)

WP-08 PR-3 / Track A-004: `promote_seed_corpus()` now optionally writes
through to a JsonlEmgStore on disk. Callers who want durability pass
`durable_store=build_emg_store(...)`; the in-memory store stays the
default for tests so existing tests pass unchanged.
